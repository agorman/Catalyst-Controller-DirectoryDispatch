=head1 NAME

Catalyst::Controller::DirectoryDispatch - Simple directory listing with built in url dispatching

=head1 VERSION

version 1.01

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    package MyApp::Controller::Browser::Example;
    use Moose;
    BEGIN { extends 'Catalyst::Controller::DirectoryDispatch' }

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        action => { setup => { Chained => '/browser/base', PathPart => 'mydir' } },
        root     => '/home/andy',
        filter     => qr{^\.|.conf$},
        data_root  => 'data',
        full_paths => 1,
    );

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Provides a simple configuration based controller for listing local system directories and dispatching them as URLs.

=head2 Example Usage

If you created the controller at http://localhost/mydir and set root to '/home/user1' then browsing to the controller might give the following output:

    {
        "success":true,
        "data":[
            "file1",
            "file2",
            "dir1",
            "dir2"
        ],
    }

You could then point your browser to http://localhost/mydir/dir1 to get a directory listing of the folder '/home/user1/dir1' and so on...

=head2 Changing Views

The default view for DirectoryDispatch serializes the file list as JSON but it's easy to change it to whatever view you'd like.

    __PACKAGE__->config(
        'default'   => 'text/html',
        'map'       => {
            'text/html' => [ 'View', 'TT' ],
        }
    );

Then in your template...

    [% FOREACH node IN response.data %]
    [% node %]
    [% END %]

=head2 Post Processing

If you need to process the files in anyway before they're passed to the view you can override process_files in your controller.

    sub process_files {
        my ($self, $c, $files) = @_;

        foreach my $file ( @$files ) {
            # Modify $file
        }

        return $files;
    }

This is the last thing that happens before the list of files are passed on to the view. $files is sent in as an ArrayRef[Str] but you
are free to return any thing you want as long as the serializer you're using can handle it.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

=head2 root

    is: ro, isa: Str

The folder that will be listed when accessing the controller (default '/').

=head2 filter

    is: ro, isa: RegexpRef

A regular expression that will remove matching files or folders from the directory listing (default: undef).

=head2 data_root

    is: ro, isa: Str

The name of the key inside $c->stash->{response} where the directory listing will be stored (default: data).

=head2 full_paths

    is: ro, isa: Bool

Returns full paths for the directory listing rather than just the names (default: 0).

=head1 THANKS

The design for this module was heavly influenced by the fantastic L<Catalyst::Controller::DBIC::API>.
